# From PyTorch to MLIP

This repository collects learning notebooks on PyTorch, PyTorch Geometric, and e3nn, following a roadmap towards MLIP models. 
The present notebooks are taken from different sources and sometimes integrated with extra material or personal notes.
This repo is meant to be used by people who want to understand what is happending behind the hood when using MLIP such as NequIP, Allegro, MACE.

## Roadmap
1. PyTorch Basics --> notebooks/00_torch_basics.ipynb
2. PyTorch
